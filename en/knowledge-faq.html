  <h1>Irrigation Design FAQ – Knowledge-Based Guidance</h1>

  <h2>1. How do I start designing an irrigation system?</h2>
  <p>You should begin by identifying the geographical location, checking the average rainfall, annual evaporation levels, and understanding the local climate zone. Then analyze the target crops and their water holding capacity.</p>

  <h2>2. What data do I need before designing?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Latitude and longitude of the field</li>
    <li>Annual rainfall and evapotranspiration (ET)</li>
    <li>Soil texture and type (e.g., loam, sandy clay)</li>
    <li>Soil nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) levels</li>
    <li>Water source pH and EC values</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. How do I know how much water my crop needs?</h2>
  <p>Use reference evapotranspiration (ET₀) data and multiply by crop coefficients (Kc) at different growth stages. PKYDrip can help calculate this using local weather data and crop databases.</p>

  <h2>4. How do I plan the irrigation layout?</h2>
  <p>Once the area and crop demand are known, plan for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Water source: well, river, tank, or reservoir</li>
    <li>Filtration system: sand filter, screen filter, etc.</li>
    <li>Main pipe and sub-main sizing based on flow and pressure</li>
    <li>Branch lines and drippers or sprinklers (flow rates: 2–6 L/h)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. What sensors can help with this?</h2>
  <p>Soil moisture sensors, NPK probes, EC/pH sensors, and weather stations can provide data that improves irrigation accuracy and saves resources.</p>

  <h2>6. Can PKYDrip provide automatic calculations?</h2>
  <p>Yes. Our cloud platform and mobile app allow users to input soil, crop, and water data and receive recommendations for irrigation duration, fertigation schedules, and zoning.</p>
