  <h1>Understanding EC and pH in Fertigation Systems</h1>

  <p>In modern agriculture, managing the balance of water and nutrients is essential to improving yield and resource efficiency. Two of the most critical indicators for nutrient solutions are <strong>EC (Electrical Conductivity)</strong> and <strong>pH (acidity/alkalinity)</strong>.</p>

  <h2>🔍 What is EC?</h2>
  <p>EC measures the electrical conductivity of a nutrient solution. It indicates the total dissolved salts (TDS), which correlate directly to the fertilizer concentration. High EC means more salts, while low EC may result in nutrient deficiency.</p>

  <h2>🧪 What is pH?</h2>
  <p>pH measures how acidic or alkaline a solution is. Most crops prefer a pH between <strong>5.5 and 6.5</strong>. If pH is too low or too high, certain nutrients become unavailable to plants, even if they are present in the solution.</p>

  <h2>💡 Why EC/pH Matter in Fertigation</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Optimize nutrient uptake</li>
    <li>Prevent salt build-up and root damage</li>
    <li>Reduce fertilizer waste and environmental runoff</li>
    <li>Enable automation of fertigation schedules</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🌿 Where EC/pH Control is Used</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Greenhouses (drip fertigation)</li>
    <li>Hydroponics and soilless cultivation</li>
    <li>Container farming</li>
    <li>Commercial open-field fertigation</li>
  </ul>
