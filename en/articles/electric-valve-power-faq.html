  <h1>Understanding Electric Valve Power Ratings in Smart Irrigation Systems</h1>

  <p><strong>Author:</strong> PKYDrip Tech Team | <strong>Published:</strong> April 2025</p>

  <h2>🔍 Common Question:</h2>
  <p><em>“My client says the electric valve is 6kW, but the supplier says it’s only 45W. Who is right?”</em></p>

  <h2>✅ Quick Answer:</h2>
  <p>This is a classic misunderstanding. A typical motorized electric valve used in irrigation systems usually consumes around <strong>45W to 100W</strong>. If someone reports a power requirement of <strong>6kW</strong>, they may be:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Mistaking the total power required for running dozens of valves simultaneously</li>
    <li>Referring to a <strong>pump</strong> rather than the valve itself</li>
    <li>Receiving an estimate from a non-technical party without accurate calculations</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>💡 How to Calculate Total Power Usage</h2>
  <p>If your irrigation system uses 10 motorized valves at the same time, and each consumes 50W:</p>
  <pre>50W x 10 valves = 500W total power required</pre>
  <p>Always add a safety margin of 10–20%, especially when sizing your power supply or inverter.</p>

  <h2>⚙️ What About 6kW?</h2>
  <p>6kW is a very large figure for valves. It’s more likely to be the power rating of a submersible or centrifugal water pump, commonly used in large-scale farms or greenhouses. Pumps have motors that run continuously, while valves are intermittent and much lower in power draw.</p>

  <h2>🧩 Real-World Example (PKYDrip Controller)</h2>
  <p>Our PKYDrip irrigation controller board (v1.0) can support up to 60 control outputs. Even if 10–20 motorized valves are activated together, total power demand is still under 1kW.</p>
